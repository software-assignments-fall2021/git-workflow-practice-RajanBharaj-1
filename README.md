## Cybersecurity
After taking some cybersecurity classes at NYU Tandon, I have learned the basic paradox of designing software seems to be convenience VS security. Upon reading this recent article about an [Apple Pay Hack](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58719891), along with noticing the general increase in data breaches and hacks over more recent years, I wonder if the tide will turn?

### Convenience
Since the rise of wireless devices and technology, it seems like for the past 10 years we have been determined to continually push for greater and greater convenience, to the point where we can spend hundreds of dollars, without ever touching our cards, certainly without even having to worry about whether we remembered our PIN. In other fields, we have keyless car entry and automatic login to nearly all of our favourite websites and applications. Everything is accessible right here and right now, but at what cost? It seems like although there are certain safety measures put in place to protect users from the inherent risks of this new technology, these protections are minimal and their effectiveness seems to repeatedly expire.

### Security
Will we finally see a slow shift of the pendulum back towards application security and data privacy in the coming years? With the rise of password managers, MFA, cryptocurrency and biometric authentication, I hope so. But even these technologies are largely neglected by the mass population and are external solutions to application security flaws. Should we force these technologies to be baked into new technology for the good of everyone, or should we continue to allow those who don't care or don't understand the risks they take online to be vulnerable?
